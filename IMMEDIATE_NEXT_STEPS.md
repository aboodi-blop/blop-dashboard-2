# üéØ Your Next Steps (Right Now!)

Based on your React web application, here's exactly what to do:

## Step 1: Build Your Application
```bash
npm run build
```
This creates a `dist` folder with your production-ready web application.

## Step 2: Test the Build Locally
```bash
npm run preview
```
This will start a local server to preview your built application.

## Step 3: Deploy to the Web

### Option A: Vercel (Recommended - Easiest)
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI if you haven't already
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy (will guide you through setup)
vercel --prod
```

### Option B: Use Your Deployment Script
```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x deploy.sh

# Run the interactive deployment script
./deploy.sh
```

### Option C: Manual Firebase Hosting (if you prefer Firebase)
```bash
# Install Firebase CLI if you haven't already
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Initialize hosting (if not done already)
firebase init hosting

# Build and deploy
npm run build
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

## Step 4: Access Your Live Application
After deploying, you'll get a URL like:
- Vercel: `https://your-app-name.vercel.app`
- Firebase: `https://your-project-id.web.app`
- Netlify: `https://random-name.netlify.app`

## ‚ùå Do NOT Run These Commands
```bash
# These are for Expo React Native projects, not your web app
npx expo export        # ‚ùå Wrong - This is for mobile apps
npx expo build         # ‚ùå Wrong - This is for mobile apps
expo start             # ‚ùå Wrong - This is for mobile apps
```

## ‚úÖ Your Correct Commands
```bash
# Development
npm run dev            # ‚úÖ Start development server

# Production
npm run build          # ‚úÖ Build for production
npm run preview        # ‚úÖ Preview production build
npm run deploy:vercel  # ‚úÖ Deploy to Vercel
npm run deploy:firebase # ‚úÖ Deploy to Firebase
npm run deploy:netlify  # ‚úÖ Deploy to Netlify
```
