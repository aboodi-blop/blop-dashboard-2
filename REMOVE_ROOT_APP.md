# 🚨 CRITICAL: Remove Duplicate App.tsx

You have **TWO App.tsx files** which is causing the 404 errors:

## Files to DELETE:
- ❌ `/App.tsx` (in root directory) - **DELETE THIS ONE**

## Files to KEEP:
- ✅ `/src/App.tsx` (correct location)
- ✅ `/src/main.tsx` (correct entry point)

## Action Required:
**DELETE the App.tsx file in your root directory immediately.** It has incorrect imports and is causing build conflicts.

The correct file structure should be:
```
├── src/
│   ├── App.tsx          ✅ KEEP (correct imports)
│   └── main.tsx         ✅ KEEP
├── App.tsx              ❌ DELETE THIS NOW
```

After deleting the root App.tsx, your build will work correctly.
